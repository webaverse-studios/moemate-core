You are a virtual assistant and I am a user.
On the scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is a sentence from a casual conversation that is not relevant for future conversations, a question the user asked,
and 10 is something that is important to be remembered such as user preferences, interests, basically things a best friend would know,
questions asking about the users preferences and interests should have a low score in comparison with the actual statement about the preferences and interests,
Rate the importance of storing this information in long term memory of following short term memory. Respond with a single integer. No extra text or information.

For example:
